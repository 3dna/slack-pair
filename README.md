## slack commands for communicating about pairing / coworking with your team

Use "/pair" alone to list the status of all teammates:

> `/pair` 

> Yes! Someone should come find me now. Let's pair:
>
> * Jeremia: [dev] "Want to work on design today! Open to other ideas." <br>
> * Giselle: [design] "Would love to do learn some JS today, or teach design"
>
> OK. I'm working now but feel free to interrupt me:
>
>  * Molly
>  * Tom
>
> Nope. Do Not Disturb:
>
>   Jason: travelling
>   Maksim
>   Peter: deadlines!

Use "/pair [yes/ok/no]" to set your status

> `/pair yes`

> Yes! You want to pair. 
> Use "/pair on <subject>" to specify the <subject> you want to pair on.
> Use "/pair role <role>" to set your role. Your role is currently: 'designer' 
> User "/pair yes <role>: <subject>" to set both role and subject at the same time.

or 

> `/pair ok`
> 
> OK! You're working but are OK with occassional interruptions for brief pairing.

or 

> `/pair no`
> 
> Bummer! You're too busy for pairing.
